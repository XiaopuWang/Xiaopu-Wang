I received my bachelor's degree from Shanxi University in 2012. Then, I joined the Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences as a master student, working on photosensitizers for photopolymerization and photodynamic therapy. After I received her master's degree in 2015, I joined Prof. Bradley Nelson's lab at ETH Zurich for doctoral study, and my PhD research topic is magnetic microrobots for biomedical applications. Multiple disciplines were involved in my PhD research, including magnetic control, micro- and nanorobotics, biodegradable materials, drug delivery, and biomedical engineering. I got her PhD degree in 2020, and my doctoral thesis won the SSB+RM 2020 Research Award issued by the Swiss Society for Biomaterial and Regenerative Medicine. In May 2020, I joined Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS) as an associate researcher.
My research interests involve microrobots, smart materials, micro-/nanofabrication, and biomedical applications. My work includes both fundamental study and application exploration. Recently, I studied the fundamental physics of magnetically driven helical microrobots, and extended the theory of magnetic helical microrobots' motion from the no-slip boundary condition to the slip boundary condition; developed pH-sensitive MOFBOTs for environment triggered drug delivery in cancer cell regions; developed biodegradable microrobots that could be degraded by cells; and functionalized the biodegradable microrbots furtherly. Some corresponding research results have been published in high-level international journals, including Advanced Materials, Advanced Functional Materials, ACS Nano, Science Advances.
